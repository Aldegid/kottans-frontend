I have used to be a little bit with Git and GitHub, but thanks to this course I improved my knowledge.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
The course is definitely important. Passed with pleasure. I felt how convenient it was to work with the command line.

## Git Collaboration
This course has helped me better understand how to work with Git and GitHub. Something was new, something fixing the material covered. In genegal, the course is very good.

## Intro to HTML and CSS
I studied HTML and CSS before. Most of the information from the course was not new to me. But repetition is always helpful.

## Responsive Web Design
I have already tried to create websites using the principles of responsive web design based on bootstrap and media queries, for example https://aldegid.github.io/YukNgalam/. This course helped me structure information about responsive design and more precisely understand how it works.
