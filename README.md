I have used to be a little bit with Git and GitHub, but thanks to this course I improved my knowledge.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
The course is definitely important. Passed with pleasure. I felt how convenient it was to work with the command line.

## Git Collaboration
This course has helped me better understand how to work with Git and GitHub. Something was new, something fixing the material covered. In genegal, the course is very good.
